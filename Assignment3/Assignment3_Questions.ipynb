    "Learning algorithms consist of a set of procedures designed to enable a computer program to learn from data and improve its performance over time. These algorithms are part of a subfield of artificial intelligence. It dictates how well a computer program can learn using a training model. The objective of learning algorithms is to observe that the rate of learning decreases with time during training, and to enable the algorithm to make formidable predictions during testing. When it comes to learning, two majors obstacles is choosing the correct loss function to measure reliance of the data and preventing overfitting.\n",

    "There are also various types of learning algorithms, including supervised and unsupervising learning. In my Introduction to AI course, our final project dealt with supervised learning! We had a 20 x 20 grid layout of a pixel image with four colored wires, two across and two down. These colored wires were laid randomly, and our goal was to cut the third wire laid in order to diffuse an impending bomb! We used a linear regression model for the first task, and multinomial regression for the second task. In our write-up, we had to clearly outline key components of a learning algorithm: input/output space, model space, loss function, type of regularization, training algorithm (or gradient descent), and testing performance."

    "As mentioned, two major types of learning algorithms are supervising learning versus unsupervised learning. Both can be discussed with respect to biological plausibility in the following manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, the learning algorithm learns from direct data, where each input-output pair is given during training. After training, the algorithm is given new data where it learns to map inputs to outputs by classifying a label during testing. In terms of biological plausability, such a strict form of learning may not prove to be efficient because it tends to lead to overfitting to the training data, leading to complications when it comes to adapting to new data. While supervised learning will work for less complex mechanisms, it may not be the most suitable to datasets that are susceptible to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, the learning algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find hidden or intrinsic structures within the data, without human intervention, via clustering or dimensionality reduction. However, this type of learning leads to less accuracy, as opposed to supervised learning. In fact, a downside to unsupervised learning is computational complexity. In terms of biological plausability, this 'free'-form of learning may be more efficient because it allows for passive changes to be taken into account when conducting statistical correlations. Therefore, even if there are outliers in the data, they are still taken into account in the process of learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we talk about two specific learning algorithms: Hebbian learning and STDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Hebbian learning, it can best be summarized by \"neurons that fire together wire together\". In terms of biological plausability, this means that the connection between neurons are stronger when activated together, or weaker otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In STDP, it is a type of Hebbian learning that takes into account temporal encoding. In terms of biological plasuability, the strength of a connection between neurons is modified based on the relative timing of spikes.\n",

    "## Answer 2b.\n",
    "First, we define that Hebbian learning is a type of unsupervised learning that is based on the idea that connections between neurons strengthen when those neurons fire together. Therefore, during learning, the connections of neurons that fire together strengthen, while the connections of neurons that do not fire together weaken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we define an AND gate is an implementation of two input neurons and one output neuron. Each input neuron represents one of the binary inputs to the AND gate (0 or 1), and the output neuron represents the output of the gate (0 or 1). If throwback to Discrete Structures, we know that the expression (A & B) is only true if both A and B are true.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now combine the two concepts together. When both input neurons are active, the output neuron should also be activated to produce a true output. Strengthening the synaptic connections between the input neurons and the output neuron when both inputs are active ensures that the output neuron is more likely to fire in response to this input pattern in the future. When both input neurons are not active or only _one_ input neuron is active, the output neuron should also not be as activated, if at all active.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this fundamental idea, we can now begin to explain algorithmically how an SNN comprising of one input layer and one output layer can learn a simple logical gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encoding:**\n",
    "First, we encode the input layer into spike trains. Each neuron in this layer is resembled by one input bit of the AND gate (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), or (1,1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward Propagation:**\n",
    "Next, we propagate spikes from the input layer to the output layer. Each connection between an input neuron and an output neuron has a weight associated with it. The output neuron integrates the weighted spikes from the input neurons over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Data:**\n",
    "   - Initialize the connection weights connecting the input neurons to the output neurons with random values.\n",
    "   - Iterate over the training data and calculate the mean firing rate.\n",
    "   - Adjust the connection weights based on mean firing rate. This should strengthen the connections that contribute to correct outputs and weaken those that contribute to incorrect outputs.\n",
    "   - Run the model for specified number of epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decoding:**\n",
    "Lastly, we decode the output spikes to determine the predicted output of the AND gate. We can do so by using a threshold value: Over the threshold would be classified as 1, or 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing Data:**\n",
    "Present new input data to the trained SNN and compare the decoded outputs with the expected outputs. We can measure the accuracy of the SNN in correctly predicting the output of the AND gate for different input patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an AND gate, this means testing it with input patterns where both inputs are 0, one input is 0 while the other is 1, and both inputs are 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the SNN-based AND gate has learned correctly through Hebbian learning, it should produce the correct output pattern (0 or 1) for each corresponding input pattern."

With the increase in weight, we can see that increasing epochs enabled that goal. So, our network can, indeed, still learn and make better predictions!

Oja's rule is useful for principal component analysis (PCA) and for extracting the principal components of the input data. It operates on a single neuron and updates its weight vector in the direction of the input vector that has the maximal variance with the current weight vector. We do this because maximum variances leads to maximum information. By focusing on the most informative dimensions of the input data, Oja's rule can lead to more efficient learning and adaptation."

    "According to the STDP model referenced in the article below, there is a weight change if there is a pre-synaptic spike in the temporal vicinity of a post-synaptic spike. The change is positive if the pre-synaptic spike occurs immediately _before_ the post-synaptic spike. Otherwise, the change is negative. Unlike hebbian learning, each connection weight in our network introduces a time delay, representing the difference between post-synaptic firing and pre-synaptic potential rise (where time in in discrete units). Membrane potential increases by the weight value of each incoming spike, but a constant is subtracted periodically to account for time delay. When the potential crosses the threshold, a spike is produced, and the potential resets to the resting level. This is the basic algorithm for STDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the same ideas from hebbian learning still apply, such as encoding, propagation, training, decoding, testing...etc. But, connection weights are updated much differently."
